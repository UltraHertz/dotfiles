* James Fletcher's Emacs configuration
** Configuration
*** User info
Configure my name and email address properly.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "James Fletcher"
      user-mail-address "m@jef.me.uk")
#+END_SRC
*** Common lisp for Emacs
(require 'cl)
** Package management
Since Emacs 24, Emacs includes the Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA)
by default. This provides a nice way to install additional
packages. Since the default package archive doesn't include everything
necessary, the marmalade, and melpa repositories are also added. 
*** Default packages
Define a list of default packages that I regularly require.

*** Install default package
Check to see if default packages are available at boot time and
install them if not.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun jamesf/packages-installed-p ()

      (package-install pkg))))
#+END_SRC
** Start-up options
I want to skip straight to the scratch buffer. This turns off the
splash screen and puts me straight into the scratch buffer. I don't
really care to have anything in there either, so turn off the message
while we're at it. Since I end up using org-mode most of the time, set
the default mode accordingly. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t
      initial-scratch-message nil
      initial-major-mode 'org-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Extra functionality
Include extra functionality provided by emacs24-starter-kit.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(mapcar 'starter-kit-load starter-kit-extras)
